SECTION 7 FIGURE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

FIGURES WITH EXISTING WRITE-UPS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 7.1: Survey Respondent Demographics Overview (6-Panel Composite)
Write-up (300 chars):
Six-panel composite showing gender distribution (62.2% male, 37.8% female), age distribution across 6 cohorts (modal: 35-44 at 33.2%), education levels (bachelor's degree modal at 30.0%), real estate experience years (50.7% with 8+ years), household income distribution, and digital confidence levels
----------------------------------------

Figure 7.2: Tokenisation Interest Distribution and Cross-Tabulation
Write-up (290 chars):
Four-panel composite showing tokenisation interest by gender, tokenisation interest by age group, overall tokenisation interest distribution (pie chart with 30.1% extremely interested, 26.3% very interested, 25.3% somewhat interested), and tokenisation interest by cryptocurrency experience
----------------------------------------

Figure 7.3: Spearman Rank Correlation Matrix
Write-up (437 chars):
Heatmap displaying Spearman rank correlations among 11 key survey variables including tokenisation interest, innovation interest, digital confidence, platform feature importance ratings, and demographic factors. Colour intensity indicates correlation strength from -1.0 (dark blue) to +1.0 (dark red), revealing notable relationships such as Digital_Confidence with Int_Tokenization (ρ=0.35) and Age_Group with Int_Tokenization (ρ=-0.54)
----------------------------------------

Figure 7.4: Interview Participant Demographics (4-Panel Composite)
Write-up (1051 chars):
The interview participant demographics composite presents four visualisations characterising the eight semi-structured interview participants. The gender distribution pie chart reveals a predominantly male sample (75%) with female representation at 25%. The age group distribution bar chart shows concentration in the 35-44 age bracket (5 participants), with single participants in the 25-34, 45-54, and 55-64 age groups respectively. The participant type pie chart demonstrates that small-scale landlords comprise the majority (62%, n=5) with fintech experts representing the remaining 38% (n=3). The years of experience histogram displays a right-skewed distribution with a mean of 12.9 years, ranging from approximately 5 to 22.5 years of industry experience. This demographic profile ensures representation from both the target user population (property owners) and domain experts (fintech professionals) necessary for validating Research Question 4 regarding user experience factors and Research Question 6 regarding financial inclusion barriers.
----------------------------------------

Figure 7.5: Theme Frequency Analysis
Write-up (1337 chars):
The thematic code frequency analysis presents horizontal bar charts across twelve thematic domains identified through systematic coding of interview transcripts. The Financing Barriers domain reveals unanimous concern regarding income documentation requirements (100%) and processing time (100%), with track record requirements (88%) and speed concerns (88%) also prominent. The Underserved Groups domain identifies small portfolio landlords (100%) and self-employed individuals (100%) as most affected by traditional financing barriers. The Technology domain shows moderate cryptocurrency awareness (50%) alongside high expectations for technological sophistication (62%). The Tokenisation Attitudes domain indicates majority enthusiasm (62%) with limited scepticism (12%). The Perceived Benefits domain highlights transaction speed (100%) and global accessibility (75%) as primary advantages. The Concerns domain reveals regulatory uncertainty (100%) and mortgage provider attitudes (75%) as dominant concerns. The Platform Requirements domain demonstrates unanimous demand for human support availability (100%), operational control retention (100%), and reserve fund protection (100%). These findings directly inform Research Question 4 regarding user experience factors and Research Question 6 regarding financial inclusion barriers.
